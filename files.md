File Shuttle - Bridge for cross-border file access
===================================================

(This document only applies to the new implementation of File Shuttle introduced in Insular v6.0+)

Any app supporting [Android Storage Access Framework (SAF)](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider) can access files across the border of Island space, such as "[FX File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx)" (Use "Connect to Storage" in pull-down menu).

When app (either inside or outside Island) requests access to an file or path, in the system dialog of SAF, you can switch the tab to **Personal (Mainland)** or **Work (Island)**.
