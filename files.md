File Shuttle - Bridge for cross-border file access
===================================================

(This document only applies to the new implementation of File Shuttle introduced in Island v6.0+)

Any app supporting [Android Storage Access Framework (SAF)](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider) can access files across the border of Island space.

When app (either inside or outside Island) requests access to an file or path, in the system dialog of SAF, you can switch the tab to Personal (Mainland) or Work (Island).
